Probably like many of my kind I've thought having a blog would be nice but have never bothered. I'm not really one for self promotion in that sense, but I'm feeling inspired...

I wanted to tinker with Docker to containerize a Nanoc blog. More just to step through some basic Docker stuff and follow through with a basic CI/CD pipline, simply for the sake of it.

**Goals:**

1. Create a blog in a container as an excuse to use Docker

2. Develop inside my container

3. When I commit changes my container will be deployed

##Set up nanoc

For this I fired up an Ubuntu VM and installed Docker as per the [Docker site instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/). I then set about [getting nanoc installed](https://nanoc.ws/doc/tutorial/)

In my case I generated a new site and created the following Gemfile

    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    gem 'nanoc'
    gem 'kramdown'
    gem 'adsf'
    gem 'compass'
    gem 'compass-h5bp'

After a trusty 

    $ bundle install

and a

    $ nanoc view

I had things running with the default site on localhost:3000

##Ramming it inside Docker

There are easier ways to host nanoc sites... but I wanted to containerize. I created my Dockerfile, and after a bit of trial and error I settled for

    FROM ruby:2.3				// gives me a base ruby image to work from (cheers) 
    RUN mkdir -p /user/src/app		// creates my target code directory inside the container
    COPY . /usr/src/app			// takes my source and puts it there
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app/blog		// sets the context for which commands will be run inside the container
    EXPOSE 3000				// exposeds a container port to the host
    RUN bundle install			// will occur when the container is created, so my Gemfile dependencies are installed in the container
    CMD bundle exec nanoc -v && bundle exec nanoc view	// the starts the nanoc site when the container starts

After a trusty 

    $ docker build -t bmantay/nanoc .

I had a built image from which my container instances can be created. Whatsmore:

    $ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bmantay/nanoc

I had my nanoc site running inside my Docker container exposed on http://localhost:3000

Withstanding any meanful content... that's pretty much my blog in a container ready for deployment.

I have of course been committing this [my Git repo](https://github.com/Brianmantay/nanoc)

##My dev environment

I'm curious about the jouney of a container from dev to prod. So I felt I wanted to ensure I'm developing the blog and its content inside the container. So for development I want 1) changes made on my local machine to be reflected inside the container... 2) nanoc to recompile when I make changes so I dont have to run 'nanoc view' inside the container evey change I make.

For the recompile on changes a common solution is to install the Guard gem. I added this to my Gemfile and created the following Guard file... it basically watches for changes on the file system and triggers a nanoc compilation:

    guard 'nanoc' do
      watch('nanoc.yaml')
      watch('Rules')
      watch(%r{^(content|layouts|lib)/.*$})
    end

With this you can now kick the site off with the 'nanoc live' instead of 'nanoc view'

To allow my changes to be reflected in the container however, I need to map a volume from my local dev to the container. This is achieved using the -v option. So I mapped my local directory home/osboxes/code/nanoc to the container /usr/src/app (specified in thte Dockerfile earlier)

I also learned you can overwrite the CMD in the Dockerfile at runtime. This allowed me to fire up Guard so my changes in the volume trigger a recompile. So, when I'm developing I can start my container like this:
 
    $ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /home/osboxes/code/nanoc:/usr/src/app bmantay/nanoc bundle exec nanoc live

Took a bit a fiddling around but I was pleased :)

##To production...

For the CD pipe my tools of choice are VSTS for build and deployment and Azure for my Docker host... mainly because I have access to these tool for free from work ;)

There were a number of things to put in place. I'll be brief.

###Azure docker host setup

1. This is great as there is a Azure template for Docker. Fire up the Azure portal and create an Ubuntu VM with Docker. 

2. This VM was going to be my docker host where my container is deployed to. But I also need a VSTS build agent running to build and push my container so for simplicty I'm using this same VM to run the build agent. To get this running I used [the Deploy an agent on Linux post](Deploy an agent on Linux) which also shows how to setup the personal access token (PAT) and run the agent as a systemd service.

3. This next bit was less fun. In order for VSTS to deploy to my Docker host from VSTS I had to setup some certificates. This was done as per [this Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/). Admittedly there was a fair bit of fiddling to get this to work for me. I was able to test this calling via curl as described in the post to ensure I was on the right track.

###VSTS setup

1. So here I created a new project and hooked up my Git repo containing this nanoc blog.

2. Installed the Docker VSTS extension that contains the steps to help me get this guy deployed. I found [this post](https://pleasereleaseme.net/continuous-delivery-with-containers-use-visual-studio-team-services-and-docker-to-build-and-deploy-asp-net-core-to-linux/) really helpful. It also show how to add in the keys generated in the previous section.

I also had to register an account with Docker Hub because my container would be published there during the deployment process before it was pushed to the Docker host in Azure.

 
3. The build / deploy step were setup as follows. 

<div class="post-image"><img src="/images/vstsbuild.png" alt="VSTS build steps" /></div>


1. **Get sources:** Pulls my changes from Git

2. **Stop container:** Runs a Docker command to stop my container from any previous deploys

3. **Remove container:** Runs a Docker command to ensure the old container is deleted

4. **Build an image:** Runs docker build on my Dockerfile

5. **Push an image:** Publishes my image to Dockerhub

6. **Run an image:** Talks to my Docker host in Azure and by calling docker run pulls my image from Dockerhub and away it goes


##Sum up

There we have it. A simple git push... and as long as I remeber to keep my Docker host running in Azure then my blog is automatically built and deployed. This is all obviously quite simplistic and for a real application you'd want to introduce additional stages and environments during the path to production. Which is something I'll take a look at shortly.
